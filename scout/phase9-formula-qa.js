## YOUR MISSION

DOVIVE's AI (P8) produced a formula specification for ${keyword}. Your job is to:
1. **Critically review** every ingredient, every dose â€" question everything
2. **Compare head-to-head** against each of the top 10 competitors
3. **Identify what's too much, what's too little, what's unjustified**
4. **Produce an adjusted formula** with precise reasoning for every change
5. **Write competitor comparison notes** that will show on each competitor's card

This is a CRITICAL QA gate. P8 AI may have over-engineered the formula. Be the expert who catches that.

## HARD ENFORCEMENT RULES (apply when writing the FINAL FORMULA BRIEF — no exceptions)

These override both Formula A and Formula B if either violates them. Do not just flag violations in the QA section — **correct them in the FINAL FORMULA BRIEF itself**. These rules apply to every supplement category.

### 1. CLINICAL DOSE FLOORS (apply to every ingredient in this formula)
For each active ingredient proposed by either AI:
- Look up the **minimum clinically studied dose** from published human research for its stated function in this product
- If the proposed dose is **below** that floor, raise it to the clinical minimum or remove the ingredient entirely
- If the proposed dose **exceeds clinical utility** (i.e., competitors are inflating a number for marketing optics with no additional benefit at that dose), correct it down to the effective ceiling
- Never keep an ingredient at a token/label-dressing dose that has no physiological effect at the amount used

### 2. INGREDIENT FORM HIERARCHY (always correct to the most bioavailable form)
For each active ingredient, identify whether a superior bioavailable form exists. Default rules:
- Always prefer **chelated or amino acid chelate forms** of minerals over inorganic salts (oxides, sulfates, carbonates)
- Always prefer **methylated or activated forms** of vitamins over synthetic precursors when a meaningful percentage of the population has impaired conversion
- Always prefer forms with **established human bioavailability data** over cheaper commodity forms
- If either AI used an inferior form, the FINAL FORMULA BRIEF must correct to the superior form and document the reason in CRITICAL ISSUES

### 3. LEAN FORMULA PRINCIPLE
- Target: **8–10 active ingredients**. Maximum 12 only if every ingredient above 10 has a distinct, non-redundant clinical role at a meaningful dose
- Every ingredient must pass all three tests: (a) dose is at or above clinical minimum for its stated function, (b) its function is not already covered by another ingredient in the formula, (c) it is not present for label aesthetics
- If either AI produced more than 12 actives, remove the weakest first: lowest dose relative to clinical floor, most redundant function
- A lean formula at clinical doses always outperforms a kitchen-sink formula with diluted amounts

### 4. MANUFACTURABILITY GATE
Before accepting the final formula, validate it against the dosage form constraints:
- **Active load**: Calculate total actives per unit (e.g., per gummy). If it exceeds the dosage form's physical limit (250–350 mg per gummy), the formula MUST be trimmed — remove or reduce lowest-priority actives until it fits. State the total active load in CRITICAL ISSUES if it fails.
- **Heat-sensitive ingredients**: Flag any active that degrades during manufacturing of the chosen form. Require encapsulated or heat-stable form in the final spec.
- **pH interactions**: Flag actives that are unstable in the product matrix pH. Require buffering, encapsulation, or form change.
- **Taste conflicts**: Flag any active with a known bitter/metallic taste at the proposed dose without a masking solution in the excipient system.
- **Ingredient incompatibilities**: Flag known absorption antagonists present together (e.g., calcium + iron, zinc + copper at high doses) and either separate into different SKUs or note the conflict.
If the formula fails any of these checks, correct it in the FINAL FORMULA BRIEF — do not just flag it.

### 5. CLINICAL CITATION CHECK
For each active ingredient in the FINAL FORMULA BRIEF:
- Verify a human clinical study exists at or near the proposed dose for the stated function
- If either AI cited a study, check that the dose and population match the claim
- If no human RCT exists at the proposed dose, flag it in WARNINGS and either justify with mechanistic evidence or reduce to the highest dose with human data
- An ingredient with no human evidence at its proposed dose must not appear in the final formula without an explicit caveat

### 5. PAIN POINTS VIA EXCIPIENTS ONLY
- Taste, texture, and tolerability complaints must be solved via the excipient and manufacturing system — NOT by adding more actives
- Never add an active ingredient to solve a problem that is a formulation or manufacturing issue

Be brutally honest. If P8 over-engineered the formula with 16 ingredients when the market only supports 4-6, say so. If our KSM-66 dose is unrealistically high for a gummy, flag it. This is the final QA gate before we send specs to a manufacturer.

⚠️ CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS (machine-parsed - do not skip or rename):
1. "## ADJUSTED FORMULA SPECIFICATION" - exact heading, two ## symbols
2. "## FINAL FORMULA BRIEF" - exact heading, must appear BEFORE ## COMPETITOR_NOTES_JSON
3. "## COMPETITOR_NOTES_JSON" - exact heading with valid JSON object

All three sections are required. If any is missing, pipeline data will not save correctly.`;

⚠️ CONSISTENCY RULE - READ FIRST:
The formula anchor below is the QA-approved final specification. Every ingredient amount, every dose, every ingredient name you reference in your analysis MUST exactly match this anchor. Do not invent different amounts. Do not reference ingredients not in this anchor. This ensures the full document is internally consistent.

## ✅ FORMULA ANCHOR - DOVIVE FINAL SPEC (do not deviate from these numbers)
${adjFormulaSummary}

---

## SUPPORTING CONTEXT (reference only - anchor above takes precedence)
### Formula A Draft (Grok 4.2 P9 - before QA):
${grokSummary}

### Formula B Draft (Claude Sonnet 4.6 P9 - before QA):
${claudeSummary}

## MARKET INTELLIGENCE
${miSummary}

## TOP COMPETITOR FORMULAS
${compRows}

## COMPETITOR FLAVOR PROFILES (detected from supplement facts)
${flavorData}

---

Generate exactly these three sections. Use exact headings.

## COMPREHENSIVE INGREDIENT COMPARISON
⚠️ DOVIVE column MUST use the exact amounts from the FORMULA ANCHOR above - no deviations.
Compare DOVIVE's formula against the top competitors for every active ingredient.

| Ingredient | DOVIVE *(exact from anchor)* | Comp #1 | Comp #2 | Comp #3 | Comp #4 | Comp #5 | Clinical Range | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
[One row per ingredient in DOVIVE anchor. DOVIVE amounts must match anchor exactly. Use exact mg from competitor supplement facts for their columns. Verdict: Under-dosed / Clinical / Over-dosed / Not used]

**Why each DOVIVE ingredient beats competitors:**
[One bullet per ingredient - specific clinical or quality reason]

**DOVIVE Unique Differentiators** (ingredients competitors don't have at clinical dose):
[bullet list]

**Competitive Gaps** (ingredients competitors have that we don't - and whether we should add them):
[bullet list]

**Bottom line - why our formula wins:**
[2-3 sentences, referencing specific amounts from the anchor]

## FLAVOR & TASTE QA
(Gummies live or die on taste - critical for repeat purchases and reviews)

**Category Flavor Intelligence:**
- Top competitor flavors: [from data above]
- What 1-star reviews say: [common taste complaints in supplement gummy category]

**Recommended Flavor Strategy for DOVIVE ${keyword}:**
| Element | Recommendation | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Primary flavor | [specific flavor name] | [why this flavor aligns with category demand and masking needs] |
| Flavor intensity | [mild/medium/bold] | [balance with active taste] |
| Sweetener system | [stevia / monk fruit / erythritol blend + amounts] | [sugar-free, no aftertaste] |
| Masking agent | [citric acid / natural flavor blend] | [cuts bitterness] |
| Color | [natural color] | [consumer expectation] |
| Texture target | [firm/soft, chew time] | [gummy standard] |

**Pilot Testing Priority:** [what to test first in CMO pilot runs]
**Risk:** [main taste risk and how to mitigate]

## FLAVOR_RECOMMENDATIONS_JSON
Return ONLY a valid JSON array with 5 to 7 items. Use this exact schema per item:
[
  {
    "flavor_name": "string",
    "rank": 1,
    "confidence": 75,
    "provenance": {
      "source_brand": "exact brand name from competitor data above, or empty string",

      "masking_strategy": "string",
      "sweetener_system": "string",
      "color_direction": "string"
    }
  }
]
Rules:
- Must return 5-7 flavors only (not less than 5, not more than 7).
- Must be grounded in provided competitor flavors + market context.
- No hardcoded generic list without evidence.
- confidence: 0-100 integer reflecting signal strength (80-100 = multiple top competitors confirmed, 50-79 = single competitor or indirect signal, 20-49 = category inference, 10-19 = sparse/emergency fallback).
- provenance: cite the specific competitor brand + ASIN + field where the flavor signal was found; use empty strings if derived from category context.

## FLAVOR_SUMMARY_JSON
Return ONLY a valid JSON object with exactly two fields:
{
  "what_worked": "Paragraph describing which competitor signals clearly drove the recommendations and why those flavors ranked highest.",
  "what_didnt": "Paragraph describing which competitor signals were weak, ambiguous, or absent, and why those flavors were ranked lower or excluded."
}

## COMPETITOR_NOTES_JSON
Return ONLY a valid JSON object. One entry per ASIN. One sentence comparing their formula to ours. Focus on the most important difference (dose, ingredient quality, or certification).
